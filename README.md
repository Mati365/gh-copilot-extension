An unofficial extension that enables `GitHub Copilot AI` to function within your web browser. 

With the integration of `ChatGPT` into `GitHub Copilot`, youâ€™ll have a unified experience. No need to pay separately for `ChatGPT` and `GitHub Copilot` â€” you can use `GitHub Copilot` as your all-in-one AI assistant for coding tasks. It combines the strengths of both tools: real-time code suggestions from Copilot and broader development guidance from `ChatGPT`.
 
## Goals âœ¨

1. **Chat Interaction with GitHub Copilot:** Enable users to select and engage in chat conversations with GitHub Copilot directly within their web browser.
2. **Participation in GitHub Discussions:** Facilitate participation in GitHub discussions related to code, issues, and projects.
3. **Automated Code Review Responses:** Assist users in responding to code reviews based on AI-generated suggestions.
4. **Typo Correction and Comment Translation on GitHub:** Automatically correct typos and translate comments within GitHub repositories.
5. **Code Review Assistance:** Provide support during code reviews.
